1641219|Does Python have “private” variables in classes?|"<p>I'm coming from the Java world and reading Bruce Eckels' <em>Python 3 Patterns, Recipes and Idioms</em>. </p>

<p>While reading about classes, it goes on to say that in Python there is no need to declare instance variables. You just use them in the constructor, and boom, they are there. </p>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre><code>class Simple:
    def __init__(self1, str):
        print(""inside the simple constructor"")
        self1.s = str
    def show(self1):
        print(self1.s)
    def showMsg (self, msg):
        print (msg + ':', self.show())
</code></pre>

<p>If that’s true, then any object of class <code>Simple</code> can just change the value of variable <code>s</code> outside of the class. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    x = Simple(""constructor argument"")
    x.s = ""test15"" # this changes the value
    x.show()
    x.showMsg(""A message"")
</code></pre>

<p>In Java, we have been taught about public/private/protected variables.  Those keywords make sense because at times you want variables in a class to which no one outside the class has access to. </p>

<p>Why is that not required in Python?</p>

610883|How to know if an object has an attribute in Python|"<p>Is there a way in Python to determine if an object has some attribute?  For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = SomeClass()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.someProperty = value
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.property
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: SomeClass instance has no attribute 'property'
</code></pre>

<p>How can you tell if <code>a</code> has the attribute <code>property</code> before using it?</p>

675442|Comment out a Python code block|"<p>Is there a mechanism to comment out large blocks of Python code?</p>

<p>Right now, the only ways I can see of commenting out code are to either start every line with a <code>#</code>, or to enclose the code in triple quotes: <code>""""""</code>.</p>

<p>The problem with these is that inserting <code>#</code> before every line is cumbersome and <code>""""""</code> makes the string I want to use as a comment show up in generated documentation.</p>

<p>After reading all comments, the answer seems to be ""No"".</p>

<ol>
<li>Leading zero if n &lt; 1</li>
<li>Add trailing decimal zero(s) to fill up fixed width</li>
<li>Truncate decimal digits past fixed width</li>
<li>Align all decimal points</li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>% formatter something like '{:06}'
numbers = [23.23, 0.123334987, 1, 4.223, 9887.2]

for number in numbers:
    print formatter.format(number)
