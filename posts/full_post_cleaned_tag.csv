For example, let's say that I have a module <code>foo</code>, and I have a string whose contents are <code>""bar""</code>. What is the best way to go about calling <code>foo.bar()</code>?

I need to get the return value of the function, which is why I don't just use <code>eval</code>. I figured out how to do it by using <code>eval</code> to define a temp function that returns the result of that function call, but I'm hoping that there is a more elegant way to do this.

<code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code>

What's the deal?!

I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.

<code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
</code>

What I did there is create a class with a public method and a private method and instantiate it.

Next, I call its public method.

<code>>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
</code>

Next, I try and call its private method.

<code>>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
</code>

Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running dir() on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.

<code>>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
</code>

This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name.

<code>>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code>

So much for encapsulation, eh?

In any case, I'd always heard Python doesn't support encapsulation, so why even try? What gives?

I've simplified the program to its bare bones for this posting. First I create a new class, create a new instance of it, assign it an attribute and then write it to a list.  Then I assign a new value to the instance and again write it to a list... and again and again...

Problem is, it's always the same object so I'm really just changing the base object.  When I read the list, I get a repeat of the same object over and over.  

So how do you write objects to a list within a loop?

Thanks,

Bob J

Here's my simplified code

<code>class SimpleClass(object):
    pass

x = SimpleClass
# Then create an empty list
simpleList = []
#Then loop through from 0 to 3 adding an attribute to the instance 'x' of SimpleClass
for count in range(0,4):       
    # each iteration creates a slightly different attribute value, and then prints it to
# prove that step is working
# but the problem is, I'm always updating a reference to 'x' and what I want to add to
# simplelist is a new instance of x that contains the updated attribute

x.attr1= '*Bob* '* count
print ""Loop Count: %s Attribute Value %s"" % (count, x.attr1)
simpleList.append(x)

print '-'*20
# And here I print out each instance of the object stored in the list 'simpleList'
# and the problem surfaces.  Every element of 'simpleList' contains the same      attribute value

y = SimpleClass
print ""Reading the attributes from the objects in the list""
for count in range(0,4):
    y = simpleList[count]
    print y.attr1
</code>

"
354883,"How do you return multiple values in Python?","The canonical way to return multiple values in languages that support it is often tupling. 

Option: Using a tuple

Consider this trivial example:

<code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0,y1,y2)
</code>

However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.

Option: Using a dictionary

The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>. 

Consider the following:

<code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0':y0, 'y1':y1 ,'y2':y2 }
</code>

(edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers)

Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example, 

<code>result['y0']
</code>

Option: Using a class

However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:

<code>class ReturnValue(object):
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code>

In python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing- After all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>ReturnValue</code>.

There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:

<code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [""y0"", ""y1"", ""y2""]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code>

From the Python Reference Manual:


  The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance.


Option: Using a list

Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:

<code>def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result
</code>

This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be. A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are mutable, wheras tuples are not. I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.

Question

After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?

I've typically found myself going the dictionary route because it involves less set-up work. From a types perspective however, you might be better off going the class route, since that may help you avoid confusing what a dictionary represents. On the other hand, there are some in the Python community that feel implied interfaces should be preferred to explicit interfaces, at which point the type of the object really isn't relevant, since you're basically relying on the convention that the same attribute will always have the same meaning. 

So, how do -you- return multiple values in Python?

But thanks to nakedfanatic for reminding me that it's often cleaner to use a dict (as a case statement) than an if/elif/else series.

Can someone please point me in the direction on how to do this? Any help is welcome.



I'm a learning programmer and I've run into a bit of a jumble. I am asked to write a program that will compute and display Fibonacci's Sequence by a user inputted start number and end number (ie. startNumber = 20 endNumber = 100 and it will display only the numbers between that range). The trick is to use it inclusively (which I do not know how to do in Python? - I'm assuming this means to use an inclusive range?).

What I have so far is no actual coding but rather:


Write Fib sequence formula to infinite
Display startNumber to endNumber only from Fib sequence.


I have no idea where to start and I am asking for ideas or insight into how to write this. I also have tried to write the Fib sequence forumla but I get lost on that as well.

750136,"How is returning the output of a function different than printing it?","In my previous question, Andrew Jaffe writes: 


  In addition to all of the other hints and tips, I think you're missing something crucial: your functions actually need to return something.
  When you create <code>autoparts()</code> or <code>splittext()</code>, the idea is that this will be a function that you can call, and it can (and should) give something back.
  Once you figure out the output that you want your function to have, you need to put it in a <code>return</code> statement.


<code>def autoparts():
    parts_dict = {}
    list_of_parts = open('list_of_parts.txt', 'r')

    for line in list_of_parts:
        k, v = line.split()
        parts_dict[k] = v

    print(parts_dict)

&gt;&gt;&gt; autoparts()
{'part A': 1, 'part B': 2, ...}
</code>

This function creates a dictionary, but it does not return something.  However, since I added the <code>print</code>, the output of the function is shown when I run the function.  What is the difference between <code>return</code>ing something and <code>print</code>ing it?

805066,"Call a parent class's method from child class in Python?","When creating a simple object hierarchy in Python, I'd like to be able to invoke methods of the parent class from a derived class.  In Perl and Java, there is a keyword for this (super).  In Perl, I might do this:

<code>package Foo;

    return ""Bamf"";
}

package Bar;
@ISA = qw(Foo);

sub frotz {
   my $str = SUPER::frotz();
   return uc($str);
}
</code>

In python, it appears that I have to name the parent class explicitly from the child.
In the example above, I'd have to do something like Foo::frotz().  

This doesn't seem right, since this behavior makes it hard to make deep hierarchies.  If children need to know what class defined an inherited method, then all sorts of information pain is created.

"
1641219,"Does Python have “private” variables in classes?","I'm coming from the Java world and reading Bruce Eckels' Python 3 Patterns, Recipes and Idioms. 

While reading about classes, it goes on to say that in Python there is no need to declare instance variables. You just use them in the constructor, and boom, they are there. 

So for example:

<code>class Simple:
    def __init__(self1, str):
        print(""inside the simple constructor"")
        self1.s = str
    def show(self1):
        print(self1.s)
    def showMsg (self, msg):
        print (msg + ':', self.show())
</code>

If that’s true, then any object of class <code>Simple</code> can just change the value of variable <code>s</code> outside of the class. 

For example: 

<code>if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    x = Simple(""constructor argument"")
    x.s = ""test15"" # this changes the value
    x.show()
    x.showMsg(""A message"")
</code>

In Java, we have been taught about public/private/protected variables.  Those keywords make sense because at times you want variables in a class to which no one outside the class has access to. 

Why is that not required in Python?

I more or less fell in love with the way Python permits me to express beautiful solutions and also with the semantics of the language that allows such a natural flow from thoughts to workable code.

What I would like to know is your answer to a kind of question I have seldom seen in this or other forums. This question seems central to me for anyone on the path to Python improvement but who wonders what his next steps should be.

Let me sum up what I do NOT want to ask first ;)


I don't want to know how to QUICKLY learn Python
Nor do I want to find out the best way to get acquainted with the language
Finally, I don't want to know a 'one trick that does it all' approach.


What I do want to know your opinion about, is:

What are the steps YOU would recommend to a Python journeyman, from apprenticeship to guru status (feel free to stop wherever your expertise dictates it), in order that one IMPROVES CONSTANTLY, becoming a better and better Python coder, one step at a time. Some of the people on SO almost seem worthy of worship for their Python prowess, please enlighten us :)

The kind of answers I would enjoy (but feel free to surprise the readership :P ), is formatted more or less like this:


Read this (eg: python tutorial), pay attention to that kind of details
Code for so manytime/problems/lines of code
Then, read this (eg: this or that book), but this time, pay attention to this
Tackle a few real-life problems
Then, proceed to reading Y.
Be sure to grasp these concepts
Code for X time
Come back to such and such basics or move further to...
(you get the point :)


I really care about knowing your opinion on what exactly one should pay attention to, at various stages, in order to progress CONSTANTLY (with due efforts, of course). If you come from a specific field of expertise, discuss the path you see as appropriate in this field.

EDIT: Thanks to your great input, I'm back on the Python improvement track! I really appreciate!

When a long-running Python script (e.g, web application) is started from within the ssh session and backgounded, and the ssh session is closed, the application will raise IOError and fail the moment it tries to write to stdout. I needed to find a way to make the application and modules output to a file rather than stdout to prevent failure due to IOError. Currently, I employ nohup to redirect output to a file, and that gets the job done, but I was wondering if there was a way to do it without using nohup, out of curiosity.

I have already tried <code>sys.stdout = open('somefile', 'w')</code>, but this does not seem to prevent some external modules from still outputting to terminal (or maybe the <code>sys.stdout = ...</code> line did not fire at all). I know it should work from simpler scripts I've tested on, but I also didn't have time yet to test on a web application yet.

Am I missing anything? Also, following is from Python documentation:

  must not be defined as formal

</code>

Now I can check if <code>mydic.has_key('key_name')</code>, but what I would like to do is print the name of the key <code>'key_name'</code>. Of course I could use <code>mydic.items()</code>, but I don't want all the keys listed, merely one specific key. For instance I'd expect something like this (in pseudo-code):

<code>print ""the key name is"", mydic['key_name'].name_the_key(), ""and its value is"", mydic['key_name']
</code>

Is there any <code>name_the_key()</code> method to print a key name?



Edit:
OK, thanks a lot guys for your reactions! :) I realise my question is not well formulated and trivial. I just got confused because i realised key_name and <code>mydic['key_name']</code> are two different things and i thought it would incorrect to print the <code>key_name</code> out of the dictionary context. But indeed i can simply use the 'key_name' to refer to the key! :)

<code>cat /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django.pth 
/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/

From there , I can access to it's location:

<code>particles[x].location = [x,y,z]

And I test for each particles if a neighbour exist by searching
in the location of each particles like:

<code>if [x+1,y,z] in particles.location
    ""find the identity of this neighbour particles in x:the index 
    of the particles array""

The problem is that the error is not always reproducible; it sometimes works with some pages, and sometimes, it barfs by throwing a <code>UnicodeEncodeError</code>. I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.

One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:

<code>agent_telno = agent.find('div', 'agent_contact_number')
agent_telno = '' if agent_telno is None else agent_telno.contents[0]
p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()

I suspect that this is because some pages (or more specifically, pages from some of the sites) may be encoded, whilst others may be unencoded.

10973766,"Understanding the map function","<code>map(function, iterable, ...)

Apply function to every item of iterable and return a list of the results. If additional iterable arguments are passed, function must take that many arguments and is applied to the items from all iterables in parallel. 

If one iterable is shorter than another it is assumed to be extended with None items. 

If function is <code>None</code>, the identity function is assumed; if there are multiple arguments, <code>map()</code> returns a list consisting of tuples containing the corresponding items from all iterables (a kind of transpose operation). 

The iterable arguments may be a sequence or any iterable object; the result is always a list.

What role does this play in making a Cartesian product?

<code>content = map(tuple, array)
</code>

What effect does putting a tuple anywhere in there have? I also noticed that without the map function the output is <code>abc</code> and with it, it's <code>a, b, c</code>.

<code>&lt;div&gt;My Button&lt;/div&gt;

I'd like to be able to search for buttons based on ""My Button"" (or non-case-sensitive, partial matches such as ""my button"" or ""button"")

I'm finding this amazingly difficult, to the extent to which I feel like I'm missing something obvious.  The best thing I have so far is:

<code>driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//div[contains(text(), ""' + text + '"")]')
</code>

This is case-sensitive, however.  The other thing I've tried is iterating through all the divs on the page, and checking the element.text property.  However, every time you get a situation of the form:

<code>&lt;div class=""outer""&gt;&lt;div class=""inner""&gt;My Button&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

div.outer also has ""My Button"" as the text.  To fix THAT, I've tried looking to see if div.outer is the parent of div.inner, but couldn't figure out how to do that (element.get_element_by_xpath('..') returns an element's parent, but it tests not equal to div.outer).  Also, iterating through all the elements on the page seems to be really slow, at least using the Chrome webdriver.

Code I've looked at has led me to believe I can call the specific column by its corresponding number, so ie: <code>Name</code> would correspond to <code>2</code> and iterating through each row using <code>row[2]</code> would produce all the items in column 2. Only it doesn't.

Here's what I've done so far:

<code>import sys, argparse, csv
from settings import *

# command arguments
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='csv to postgres',\
 fromfile_prefix_chars=""@"" )
parser.add_argument('file', help='csv file to import', action='store')
args = parser.parse_args()
csv_file = args.file

# open csv file
with open(csv_file, 'rb') as csvfile:

    # get number of columns
    for line in csvfile.readlines():
        array = line.split(',')
        first_item = array[0]

    num_columns = len(array)
    csvfile.seek(0)

    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ')
        included_cols = [1, 2, 6, 7]

    for row in reader:
            content = list(row[i] for i in included_cols)
            print content
</code>

and I'm expecting that this will print out only the specific columns I want for each row except it doesn't, I get the last column only.

16720541,"Python string.replace regular expression","I have a parameter file of the form

<code>parameter-name parameter-value
</code>

where the parameters may be in any order but there is only one parameter per line.  I want to replace one parameter's parameter-value with a new value.

I am using a line replace function posted previously (Search and replace a line in a file in Python) to replace the line which uses python's string.replace(pattern, subst).  The regular expression that I'm using works for instance in vim but doesn't appear to work in string.replace.  Here is the regular expression that I'm using:

<code>line.replace(""^.*interfaceOpDataFile.*$/i"", ""interfaceOpDataFile %s"" % (fileIn))
</code>

where interfaceOpDataFile is the parameter name that I'm replacing (/i for case insensitive) and the new parameter value is the contents of the fileIn variable.  Is there a way to get python to recognize this regular expression or else is there another way to accomplish this task?  Thanks in advance.

16819222,"How to return dictionary keys as a list in Python","I have noticed a difference in Python 2.7 and old versions of Python 3 compared to Python >= 3.3.



Previously in Python 2.7, I could get dictionary keys, values, or items as a list:

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; newdict = {1:0, 2:0, 3:0}
&gt;&gt;&gt; newdict.keys()
[1, 2, 3]
</code>

Now in Python >= 3.3 I get something this:

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; newdict.keys()
dict_keys([1, 2, 3])
</code>

So I have to do this to get a list:

<code>newlist = list()
for i in newdict.keys():
    newlist.append(i)
</code>



I am wondering if there is a better way to return a list in Python 3?

17330160,"How does the @property decorator work?","I would like to understand how the built-in function <code>property</code> works. What confuses me is that <code>property</code> can also be used as a decorator, but it only takes arguments when used as a built-in function and not when used as a decorator.

This example is from the documentation:

<code>class C(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None

    def getx(self):
        return self._x
    def setx(self, value):
        self._x = value
    def delx(self):
        del self._x
    x = property(getx, setx, delx, ""I'm the 'x' property."")
</code>

<code>property</code>'s arguments are <code>getx</code>, <code>setx</code>, <code>delx</code> and a doc string.

In the code below <code>property</code> is used as decorator. The object of it is the <code>x</code> function, but in the code above there is no place for an object function in the arguments.

<code>class C(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._x = None

    @property
    def x(self):
        """"""I'm the 'x' property.""""""

    @x.setter
    def x(self, value):
        self._x = value

    @x.deleter
    def x(self):
        del self._x
</code>

And, how are the <code>x.setter</code> and <code>x.deleter</code> decorators created?
I am confused.

My Python code says:

<code>import cv2
</code>

But that line throws the error shown in the title of this question.

I have OpenCV installed in <code>C:\lib\opencv</code> on this 64-bit machine. I'm using 64-bit Python.

My PYTHONPATH variable: <code>PYTHONPATH=C:\lib\opencv\build\python\2.7</code>. This folder contains <code>cv2.pyd</code> and that's all.

My PATH variable: <code>Path=%OPENCV_DIR%\bin;...</code> This folder contains 39 DLL files such as <code>opencv_core246d.dll</code>.

OPENCV_DIR has this value: <code>OPENCV_DIR=C:\lib\opencv\build\x64\vc11</code>.

The solution at ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application says to add ""the new opencv binaries path (<code>C:\opencv\build\bin\Release</code>) to the Windows PATH environment variable"". But as shown above, I already have the OpenCV binaries folder (<code>C:\lib\opencv\build\x64\vc11\bin</code>) in my PATH. And my OpenCV installation doesn't have any Release folders (except for an empty one under build/java).

Any ideas as to what's going wrong? Can I tell Python to verbosely trace the loading process? Exactly what DLL's is it looking for?

Thanks,
Lars

EDIT:

I just noticed that, according to http://www.dependencywalker.com/, the <code>cv2.pyd</code> in <code>C:\lib\opencv\build\python\2.7</code> is 32-bit, whereas the machine and the Python I'm running are 64-bit. Could that be the problem? And if so, where can I find a 64-bit version of cv2.pyd?

20646822,"How to serve static files in Flask","So this is embarrassing. I've got an application that I threw together in <code>Flask</code> and for now it is just serving up a single static HTML page with some links to CSS and JS. And I can't find where in the documentation <code>Flask</code> describes returning static files. Yes, I could use <code>render_template</code> but I know the data is not templatized. I'd have thought <code>send_file</code> or <code>url_for</code> was the right thing, but I could not get those to work. In the meantime, I am opening the files, reading content, and rigging up a <code>Response</code> with appropriate mimetype:

<code>import os.path

from flask import Flask, Response

I am running Mac OS X 10.9.1 and I am using the Python Launcher app that came with the install of python 3.3 to run the script.

Edit: I realized I am somehow running these scripts with 2.7. I guess the real question is how do I run my scripts with version 3.3? I thought if I dragged and dropped my scripts on top of the Python Launcher app that is inside the Python 3.3 folder in my applications folder that it would launch my scripts using 3.3. I guess this method still launches scripts with 2.7. So How do I use 3.3?
