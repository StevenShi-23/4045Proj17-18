3061,"Calling a function of a module from a string with the function's name","<p>What is the best way to go about calling a function given a string with the function's name in a Python program.  For example, let's say that I have a module <code>foo</code>, and I have a string whose contents are <code>""bar""</code>. What is the best way to go about calling <code>foo.bar()</code>?</p>

<p>I need to get the return value of the function, which is why I don't just use <code>eval</code>. I figured out how to do it by using <code>eval</code> to define a temp function that returns the result of that function call, but I'm hoping that there is a more elegant way to do this.</p>

<p>Hours and minutes are integers, and seconds is a float.  the str() function will convert all of these numbers to the tenths (0.1) place.  So instead of my string outputting ""5:30:59.07 pm"", it would display something like ""5.0:30.0:59.1 pm"".</p>

70528,"Why are Python's 'private' methods not actually private?","<p>Python gives us the ability to create 'private' methods and variables within a class by prepending double underscores to the name, like this: <code>__myPrivateMethod()</code>. How, then, can one explain this</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>What's the deal?!</p>

<p>I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
</code></pre>

<p>What I did there is create a class with a public method and a private method and instantiate it.</p>

<p>Next, I call its public method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I try and call its private method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
</code></pre>

<p>Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running <em>dir()</em> on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.</p>

<pre><code>>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
</code></pre>

<p>This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>So much for encapsulation, eh?</p>

<p>In any case, I'd always heard Python doesn't support encapsulation, so why even try? What gives?</p>

<h3>Option: Using a tuple</h3>

<p>Consider this trivial example:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0,y1,y2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.</p>

<h3>Option: Using a dictionary</h3>

<p>The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>. </p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0':y0, 'y1':y1 ,'y2':y2 }
</code></pre>

<p>(edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers)</p>

<p>Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example, </p>

<pre><code>result['y0']
</code></pre>

<h3>Option: Using a class</h3>

<p>However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>

<p>In python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing- After all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>ReturnValue</code>.</p>

<p>There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [""y0"", ""y1"", ""y2""]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code></pre>

<p>From the <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pylang/__slots__.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python Reference Manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Option: Using a list</h3>

<p>Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:</p>

<pre><code>def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result
</code></pre>

<p>This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be. A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable"" rel=""noreferrer"">mutable</a>, wheras tuples are not. I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?</p>

<p>I've typically found myself going the dictionary route because it involves less set-up work. From a types perspective however, you might be better off going the class route, since that may help you avoid confusing what a dictionary represents. On the other hand, there are some in the Python community that feel <a href=""http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/isinstance/"" rel=""noreferrer"">implied interfaces should be preferred to explicit interfaces</a>, at which point the type of the object really isn't relevant, since you're basically relying on the convention that the same attribute will always have the same meaning. </p>

<p>So, how do -you- return multiple values in Python?</p>

1641219,"Does Python have “private” variables in classes?","<p>I'm coming from the Java world and reading Bruce Eckels' <em>Python 3 Patterns, Recipes and Idioms</em>. </p>

<p>While reading about classes, it goes on to say that in Python there is no need to declare instance variables. You just use them in the constructor, and boom, they are there. </p>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre><code>class Simple:
    def __init__(self1, str):
        print(""inside the simple constructor"")
        self1.s = str
    def show(self1):
        print(self1.s)
    def showMsg (self, msg):
        print (msg + ':', self.show())
</code></pre>

<p>If that’s true, then any object of class <code>Simple</code> can just change the value of variable <code>s</code> outside of the class. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    x = Simple(""constructor argument"")
    x.s = ""test15"" # this changes the value
    x.show()
    x.showMsg(""A message"")
</code></pre>

<p>In Java, we have been taught about public/private/protected variables.  Those keywords make sense because at times you want variables in a class to which no one outside the class has access to. </p>

<p>Why is that not required in Python?</p>

<li>Code for so manytime/problems/lines of code</li>
<li>Then, read this (eg: this or that book), but this time, pay attention to this</li>
<li>Tackle a few real-life problems</li>
<li>Then, proceed to reading Y.</li>
<li>Be sure to grasp these concepts</li>
<li>Code for X time</li>
<li>Come back to such and such basics or move further to...</li>
<li>(you get the point :)</li>

Summing up the answers thus far - <code>os.getcwd()</code> and <code>os.path.abspath()</code> both give the current working directory which may or may not be the directory where the script resides. In my web host setup <code><code>__file__</code></code> gives only the filename without the path.</p>

<p>Isn't there any way in Python to (always) be able to receive the path in which the script resides?</p>

I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.</p>

<pre><code>driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//div[contains(text(), ""' + text + '"")]')

<p>This is case-sensitive, however.  The other thing I've tried is iterating through all the divs on the page, and checking the element.text property.  However, every time you get a situation of the form:</p>

<p>div.outer also has ""My Button"" as the text.  To fix THAT, I've tried looking to see if div.outer is the parent of div.inner, but couldn't figure out how to do that (element.get_element_by_xpath('..') returns an element's parent, but it tests not equal to div.outer).
